# Experimental Twitch Bot

Bot has been developed to learn twitch library within 1 day and includes only basic functionalities for beginning. I want to include some other applications like telegram and discord when I have time to learn these APIs.

# Update 0.2 Notes:
- Telegram bot integrated now. Your telegram bot can send a notification message to a group, or a channel. Bot sends the notification when only application start, but custom notifications will be available in future.
- You able to set config files to send notification or any other features.
- Contents files and config files moved to documents\Granzwelt\RudyAsBot.
- List, counter, and timer messages added.
- Bot can inform users about current music. (!sarki)
