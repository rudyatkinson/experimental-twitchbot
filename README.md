# Experimental Twitch Bot

Bot has been developed to learn twitch library within 1 day and includes only basic functionalities for beginning. I want to include some other applications like telegram and discord when I have time to learn these APIs.

# Update Notes:
###### 0.2 (Telegram)
- Telegram bot integrated now. Your telegram bot can send a notification message to a group, or a channel. Bot sends the notification when only application start, but custom notifications will be available in future.
- You able to set config files to send notification or any other features.
- Contents files and config files moved to documents\Granzwelt\RudyAsBot.
- List, counter, and timer messages added.
- Bot can inform users about current music. (!sarki)

# Why am I developing this?
It is just a hobby for me. I have a few friends who already streaming and I am using the bot in their channel to see what is missing or what should be added in future. RudyAsBot will include all of the usual functionalities in future and anyone will be able to modify functions according to needs or add completely new features.
